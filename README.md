# Branching Dialogue System for Unity
A **node based** branching dialogue system created by me for Unity,  which can visualise the dialogues in **graphs**.

*warning -- the graph's current capabilities are limited. It is mostly for visualisation of already created dialogue nodes. Text and connections between existing nodes can be edited and saved. However, new nodes cannot be created in the graph, yet.*
